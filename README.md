Overview
This project implements a Student Management System that utilizes C++ classes and headers to manage student records, courses, and degrees. The system is designed to keep track of students, their associated degrees, and other important information using structures and object-oriented principles.

Features
Student Record Management: Store and manage information such as student ID, name, email, and degree program.
Degree Tracking: Different degree programs (e.g., Computer Science, Engineering) are tracked for each student.
Roster Management: A roster system that maintains a list of students enrolled in the program.
Simple User Interface: Command-line interface to add, update, and display student records and degrees.
Technologies Used
C++: The main programming language used for implementing the system.
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Classes and inheritance used for managing student data and degrees.
File I/O: Data is saved and loaded from text files to persist between program executions.
